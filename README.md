# Digital Circuit on an FPGA using Verilog

## Aim: To learn Verilog, implement a simple circuit, and to solve a problem using the simple circuit. 

### Part A: To design a mod-n counter in Verilog.

Problem Statement: Using Verilog, write a hardware description to create a counter that will count up to n. The counter should send a high output on y whenever it reaches n, then promptly reset back to 0.


Hint: The input clock is a square wave. It has a number of rising edges and falling edges. Write a hardware description that counts the number of rising edges to solve the program. 

reset sets the counter to 0 irrespective of current count. The counter should only be functional when en is 1. 

### Part B: Solve a design problem

Ajay has a button in his circuit. He notices that for a single button press, his circuit registers multiple button presses. 
Guess the potential problem in his circuit. Note that the human reaction time is extremely slow compared to a switching clock signal. 
Suggest a solution to the above problem. Use the circuit described in Part A to solve this issue.
Attempt to simulate the issue and show that your solution can fix this issue. Use the tools available in Xilinx Vivado for the same. (bonus)
Milestones:
#### Week 1:
Learn Verilog; Understand the basics of digital circuits, and their description in Verilog.
Get comfortable with the software. 
#### Week 2:
Get started on the counter description.
Finish the counter description.
#### Week 3:
Start ideating on potential solutions for the issue; Write down the block diagram.
Attempt to simulate the issue, if time permits.

Getting Started: Contact your mentor. Get the software installed on your laptop. Read up on basics of digital circuits.
